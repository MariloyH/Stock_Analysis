# stock-analysis  VBA_Challenge
##  Overview
  Steve is advicing his parents in stocks investsments. we built for him a MACRO in VBA and excel which analizes all stocks from a explicit year, but he is worried about the perfomance of that procedure if we analize thousand of stocks. We will refactor previous code to improve its performance. 
  For this, we are going tu use arrays to storage values instead only variables. 
  
## Results



## Summary 
When we start from an existing code, we must to be sure to understand what does the whole code must do and what does each line of code do, because is very easy to do something wrong and spoil the things! 
### Advantages
  We begin from an existing code, so we will have a solution in less time (assuming previous code does what it supose to do) 
  we work only in some parts of the code, not in the whole code. }
  
### Disadvantages 
   If previous code is not properly commented, we could spend a lot of time guessing what the previuos coder did.
   If we are not careful, we can make the code more complex and affect the performance of the execution.
   
   
  

succesful runnig code, so we can lok each procedure 

In this case, we used a variable called tickerIndex which indicated what ticker we are analizing. Also, we introduce arrays to store the acumulate volume of tickers and its starting and ending price. I inserted a third button too, to facilitate runnig botn analysis, the original and the recfatored.
