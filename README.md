# stock-analysis  VBA_Challenge
##  Overview
  Steve is advicing his parents in stocks investsments. we built for him a MACRO in VBA and excel which analizes all stocks from a explicit year, but he is worried about   the perfomance of that procedure if we analize thousand of stocks. We will refactor previous code to improve its performance. 
  For this, we are going tu use arrays to storage values instead only variables. 
  
## Results
   I inserted a third button too, to facilitate runnig botn analysis, the original and the recfatored. 


## Summary 
### Refactoring code in general 
When we start from an existing code, we must to be sure to understand what is the problem that the code resolves anb from that what does the whole code must do and what does each line of code do, because is very easy to do something wrong and spoil the things!  
#### Advantages
  -We begin from an existing code, so we will have a solution in less time (assuming previous code does what it supose to do). 
  -We work only in some parts of the code, not in the whole code.   
#### Disadvantages 
   -If previous code is not properly commented, we could spend a lot of time guessing what the previuos coder did.
   -If we are not careful, we can make the code more complex and affect the performance of the execution.
   -If we are adding new functions, we must be careful not to affect behavior that was previously working well. 
   
### Refactoring this VBA scrip
   As advantage, the previous code was written for me, so I knew what I did, so It minimized the error posssibility. This code was runnig and working well. The new code introduced a new way to store the values in an array  that improve the performance of the code. I donÂ´t see any disavantages, because the resukt was succesful.
