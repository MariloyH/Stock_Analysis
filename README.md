# stock-analysis  VBA_Challenge
##  Overview
  Steve is advicing his parents in stocks investsments. we built for him a MACRO in VBA and excel which analizes all stocks from a explicit year, but he is worried about the perfomance of that procedure if we analize thousand of stocks. We will refactor previous code to improve its performance. 
  For this, we are going tu use arrays to storage values instead only variables. 
  
## Results



## Summary 
When we start from an existing code, we must to be sure to understand what does the whole code must do and what does each line of code do, because is very easy to do something wrong and spoil the things! 
### Advantages
We take a succesful runnig code, so we can lok each procedure 

In this case, we used a variable called tickerIndex which indicated what ticker we are analizing. Also, we introduce arrays to store the acumulate volume of tickers and its starting and ending price. I inserted a third button too, to facilitate runnig botn analysis, the original and the recfatored.
